    WARNING: These changes may break binary compatibility with previous
    versions of GeographicLib.  However, the library is source
    compatible (with the proviso that GeographicLib/GeodesicLine.hpp may
    now need to be included).

    geodesic polygons.

  * Improve iterative solution of GeographicLib::Gnomonic::Reverse.

  * Add GeographicLib::Geoid::ConvertHeight.

  * Add -msltohae, -haetomsl, and -z options to \ref geoideval.

  * Constructors check that minor radius is positive.

  * Add overloaded Forward and Reverse functions to the projection
    classes which don't return the convergence (or azimuth) and scale.

  * Document function parameters and return values consistently.

Changes between 1.3 (released 2010-07-21) and 1.2 versions:

  * Add GeographicLib::Gnomonic, the ellipsoid generalization of the
    gnomonic projection.

  * Add -g and -e options to Equidistanttest.

  * Use fixed-point notation for output from Cartconvert,
    Equidistanttest, Transversemercatortest.

    + Improved conversion to conformal coordinates;
    + Fix bug with scale at opposite pole;
    + Complain if latitude out of range in SetScale.

  * Add GeographicLib::Math::NaN().

  * Add long double version of hypot for Windows.

  * Add EllipticFunction::E(real).

  * Update references to Geotrans in MGRS documentation.

  * Speed up tmseries.mac.

Changes between 1.2 (released 2010-05-21) and 1.1 versions:

    DMS::Encode to deal with distances.

  * Code and documentation changes in Geodesic and Geocentric for
    consistency with the forthcoming paper on geodesics.

  * Increase order of series using in Geodesic to 6 (full accuracy
    maintained for ellipsoid flattening < 0.01).

  * Macro __NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH to disable use of long double.

  * Correct declaration of Math::isfinite to return a bool.

  * Changes in the Utility Programs,
    + improve error reporting when parsing command line arguments;

    + CartConvert allows the ellipsoid to be specified with -e.

Changes between 1.1 (released 2010-02-09) and 1.0 versions:

Changes between 1.0 (released 2010-01-07) and 2009-11 versions:

  * Add autoconf configuration files.

  * BUG FIX: Improve initial guess for Newton's method in
    PolarStereographic::Reverse.  (Previously this failed to converge
    when the co-latitude exceeded about 130 deg.)

  * Constructors for TransverseMercator, TransverseMercatorExact,
    PolarStereographic, Geocentric, and Geodesic now check for obvious
    problems with their arguments and throw an exception if necessary.

    so that you can determine how instances were constructed.

  * Add GeographicLib::LambertConformalConic class.

  * Add GeographicLib::PolarStereographic::SetScale to allow the
    latitude of true scale to be specified.

  * Add solution and project files for Visual Studio 2008.

  * Add GeographicLib::GeographicErr for exceptions.

  * GeographicLib::Geoid changes:
    + BUG FIX: fix typo in GeographicLib::Geoid::Cache which could cause
      a segmentation fault in some cases when the cached area spanned
      the prime meridian.
    + Include sufficient edge data to allow heights to be returned for
      cached area without disk reads;
    + Add inspector functions to query the extent of the cache.

Changes between 2009-11 and 2009-10 versions:

  * Allow specification of "closest UTM zone" in GeographicLib::UTMUPS
    and GeoConvert (via -t option).

  * Utilities now complain is there are too many tokens on input lines.

  * Include real-to-real versions of GeographicLib::DMS::Decode and
    GeographicLib::DMS::Encode.

  * More house-cleaning changes:
    + Ensure that functions which return results through reference
      arguments do not alter the arguments when an exception is thrown.
    + Improve accuracy of GeographicLib::MGRS::Forward.
    + Include more information in some error messages.
    + Improve accuracy of inverse hypobolic functions.
    + Fix the way GeographicLib::Math functions handle different
      precisions.

Changes between 2009-10 and 2009-09 versions:

  * Change web site to http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net

  * Several house-cleaning changes:
    + Change from the a flat directory structure to a more easily
      maintained one.
    + Introduce Math class for common mathematical functions (in
      Constants.hpp).
    + Use Math::real as the type for all real quantities.  By default this
      is typedefed to double; and the library should be installed this
      way.
    + Eliminate const reference members of AzimuthalEquidistant,
      CassiniSoldner and LocalCartesian so that they may be copied.
    + Make several constructors explicit.  Disallow some constructors.
      Disallow copy constructor/assignment for Geoid.
    + Document least square formulas in Geoid.cpp.
    + Use unsigned long long for files positions of geoid files in Geoid.

      UTMUPS::Reverse to enforce stricter MGRS limits on eastings and
      northings.in
    + Add 64-bit targets in Visual Studio project files.

    of the azimuthal scale instead of the reduced length.

  * Add -n option to GeoConvert.

Changes between 2009-07 and 2009-06 versions:

  * Speed up the series inversion code in tmseries.mac and geod.mac.

      method,
    + accept and return spherical arc lengths,
    + works with both oblate and prolate spheroids,
    + add -a, -e, -b options to the Geod utility.

Changes between 2009-03 and 2009-02 versions:
